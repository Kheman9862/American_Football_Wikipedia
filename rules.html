                <h2>THE GAME</h2>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Normal play consists of two teams of
                    <span class="textcolor">11 players</span> on field (one on
                    offence the other on defence) competing during four
                    <span class="textcolor">15 minute</span> quarters.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    There are usually
                    <span class="textcolor">three ‘time-outs’</span> per half
                    for each team, with a 12 minutes half-time interval.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The purpose of the game is to move the ball into the
                    opposition's <span class="textcolor">‘end zone’</span>,
                    either by running with the ball until tackled, or by passing
                    the ball to a teammate downfield, towards the end zone.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Although there are only 11 players from each side on the
                    field at any one time, a team is actually made up of
                    <span class="textcolor">45 players.</span> The
                    <span class="textcolor">key player</span> on each side is
                    the <span class="textcolor">quarterback</span> who attempts
                    to dictate play.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </div>
            </div>

          <div class="spacing">
            <div class="row" id="modify">
              <div class="col-6">
                <div class="downheading">
                  <h2>DOWNS</h2>
                </div>
                <div class="downinfo">
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Downs are the part of the game which often needlessly
                      confuses newcomers. They are actually fairly
                      straightforward. In a nutshell, the rule is as follows:
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      The team in possession of the ball (offence) needs to move
                      the ball forward by at least
                      <span class="textcolor">10 yards</span> while they are on
                      offence. This is why the pitch has clearly
                      <span class="textcolor">marked yardage</span> lines on it.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      They have <span class="textcolor">four chances,</span> or
                      downs, to gain those 10 yards and if they advance the ball
                      that far, the count
                      <span class="textcolor">resets</span> and the team earns
                      another set of four downs to try go a further
                      <span class="textcolor">10 yards.</span>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      If the offensive team fails to move these 10 yards within
                      four downs, <span class="textcolor">possession</span> is
                      then given up and the defensive side gets their turn to
                      play offense. Teams will usually
                      <span class="textcolor">kick for a field goal</span> or
                      downfield to the defending team on the fourth down to try
                      and salvage some points before they lose possession.

                      if the kicker is close enough to the end zone to kick the

                      through the uprights after a touchdown (it’s similar to a
                      conversion in rugby).
                      <span class="textcolor">Two points</span> are earned by
                      taking the ball into the end zone again, but since it is
                      more difficult, most teams opt to take the 1pt.
