              <span class="textcolor">American football</span>, also known
              as<span class="textcolor"> gridiron</span>, is widely seen and
              played in both the
              <span class="textcolor">United States</span> and
              <span class="textcolor">Canada.</span> It is a team game in which
              each team has <span class="textcolor">eleven players</span> on the
              playground. The playground is rectangular in shape and has
              goalposts at each end. It is divided into two parts, offensive and
              defensive, which will be discussed further in the next section.
              American football was created by combining several sports such as
              <span class="textcolor">rugby</span> and
              <span class="textcolor">association football</span>.
              <span class="textcolor">Walter Camp</span> is the man behind the
              rule change that led to the invention of the game and is therefore
              also known as the
              <span class="textcolor">"father of American football"</span>.
              These changes led to the legalization of blocking the
              <span class="textcolor"
                >line of scrimmage, down-and-distance rules</span
              >. Then with a period of time in the late 19th century, some
              coaches helped introduce the new rule of the "forward pass".The
              origin of football may be derived back to 1919, with
              <span class="textcolor">William "Pudge" Heffelfinger's</span> $500
              contract to play in an exceedingly game for the Allegheny River
              Athletic Association against the Pittsburgh Athletic Club. In 1920
              the American football Association was fashioned. This league
              modified its name to the
              <span class="textcolor">National League(NFL)</span> 2 years later,
              and eventually became the foremost league of American football.
              Primarily a sport of western industrial cities within the U.S,
              football eventually became a national development.

          The modern era of American soccer is thought-about to possess begun
          when the <span class="textcolor">1932</span> NFL game, that was 1st
          the primary indoor game since 1902 and therefore the first football
          game to feature <span class="textcolor">hash marks</span>, forward
          passes anyplace behind the road of scrimmage, and therefore the
          movement of the goalposts back to the line. different innovations to
          occur in <span class="textcolor">real-time</span> when 1932 were the
          introduction of the AP Poll in 1934, the tapering of the ends of the
          soccer in 1934, the subsidization of the primary
          <span class="textcolor">Heisman Trophy</span> in 1935, 1st the primary
          NFL Draft in 1936 and therefore the first televised game in 1939.
          Another vital event was the football game at the 1932
          <span class="textcolor">Summer Olympic Games</span>, that combined
          with the same demonstration game at 1933 World's truthful,

          league to the NFL, the
          <span class="textcolor">American football League (AFL)</span>, began
          to play in 1960; the pressure is placed on the senior league

          the creation of the <span class="textcolor">Super Bowl</span>, that
          has become the most-watched tv event within the U.S on associate
          degree annual basis.
