              <b>The National Football League (NFL):</b> It is a
              <span class="textcolor">professional</span> American football
              league consisting of 32 teams, divided equally between the
              <span class="textcolor">National Football Conference (NFC)</span>
              and the
              <span class="textcolor">American Football Conference (AFC).</span>
              The NFL is one of the four major professional sports leagues in
              North America and the highest professional level of American
              football in the world.The NFL's
              <span class="textcolor">17-week</span> regular season runs from
              early September to late December, with each team playing 16 games
              and having one bye week. Following the conclusion of the regular
              season, <span class="textcolor">six teams</span> from each
              conference (four division winners and
              <span class="textcolor">two wild card teams</span>) advance to the
              playoffs, a single-elimination tournament culminating in the
              <span class="textcolor">Super Bowl</span>, which is usually held
              on the first <span class="textcolor">Sunday</span> in February and
              is played between the champions of the NFC and AFC.

              The NFL was formed in 1920 as the
              <span class="textcolor"
                >American Professional Football Association (APFA)</span
              >
              before renaming itself the National Football League for the 1922
              season. After initially determining champions through
              end-of-season standings, a playoff system was implemented in 1933
              that culminated with the
              <span class="textcolor">NFL Championship</span> Game until 1966.
              Following an agreement to merge the NFL with the American Football
              League (AFL), the <span class="textcolor">Super Bowl</span> was
              first held in 1967 to determine a champion between the best teams
              from the <span class="textcolor">two leagues</span> and has
              remained as the final game of each NFL season since the merger was
              completed in 1970. Today, the NFL has the<span class="textcolor">
                highest average attendance (67,591)</span
              >
              of any professional sports league in the world and is the most
              popular sports league in the United States.[5] The Super Bowl is
              also among the biggest club sporting events in the world,[6] with
              the individual games accounting for many of the most watched
              television programs in
              <span class="textcolor">American history</span> and all occupying
              the Nielsen's Top 5 tally of the all-time most watched U.S.
              television broadcasts by 2015.

              The Green Bay Packers hold the most combined NFL championships
              with 13, winning nine titles before the Super Bowl era and four
              Super Bowls afterwards. Since the creation of the Super Bowl, the
              Pittsburgh Steelers and New England Patriots both have the most
              championship titles at six. The
              <span class="textcolor">Patriots</span> are the NFL's current
              champions following their victory over the Los Angeles Rams in
              Super Bowl LIII.
